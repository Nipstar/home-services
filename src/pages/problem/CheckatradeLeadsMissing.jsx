                "Whether you're paying for Checkatrade, MyBuilder, Bark, Rated People, or running Google Local Services Ads, you are paying hard-earned money to make your phone ring.",
                "Let's look at the maths. If you pay £100 a month for a directory listing, and it generates 10 calls a month, each call costs you £10. If you are on site and miss 5 of those calls, your cost-per-lead immediately doubles. You are essentially throwing £50 into a fire every month.",
                "And the reality is much worse. Those platforms actively encourage customers to message 3 to 5 pros at the same time. It's an absolute footrace. The platform sends the customer's detail to multiple tradesmen, and the first one to respond wins the job 80% of the time.",
                "You cannot out-market bad operations. There is absolutely no point spending money on SEO, lead gen platforms, or advertising until you have a watertight system for actually answering the phone the second it rings."
