    { q: "Will my customers know it's AI?", a: "Most can't tell. Natural voice, UK accent, proper conversations. Customers compliment tradesmen on their 'lovely receptionist.'" },
    { q: "I'm not techy at all — can I set this up?", a: "If you can answer a phone call, you can use this. We handle setup. Takes about a day." },
    { q: "What if someone has a genuine emergency?", a: "You set the rules. Burst pipe or no heating with a baby = immediate alert/patch-through." },
    { q: "What if the AI can't answer a question?", a: "It's honest: 'I don't have that info, but I'll make sure Dave gets back to you today.' Takes details, flags it." },
    { q: "How much does it cost?", a: "From £97/mo. No contracts, no setup fees. Free 7-day trial. One extra job pays for itself." },
    { q: "Can it book appointments in my diary?", a: "Yes — integrates with Tradify, ServiceM8, Google Calendar. Or captures details for you to book manually." },
    { q: "What about GDPR?", a: "Fully compliant. Encrypted. UK/EU servers. You control what's recorded and retention." },
    { q: "I already pay for an answering service — why switch?", a: "Traditional services: £1-2/call, generic operators, business hours only. AI: flat monthly fee, knows your trade, works 24/7." }

    { q: "What if I want to cancel?", a: "No problem at all. There's no contract and no cancellation fee. Cancel with a single click from your dashboard. We'll even help you port your number back if you need it." },
    { q: "Do I keep my existing phone number?", a: "Yes. You can divert your current mobile or landline to your AI agent number. Your customers never see a different number — it's completely seamless." },
    { q: "How long does setup actually take?", a: "Most businesses are fully live within 24 hours. We do all the heavy lifting — training the AI on your services, setting up your number, configuring your preferences. You just answer a few questions about your business." },

    { q: "Is there really no contract?", a: "Absolutely no contract. Everything is on a 30-day rolling basis. You can cancel with a single click anytime." },
    { q: "What constitutes a 'minute'?", a: "We only count actual conversation time when a human is speaking to the AI. Short 15-second spam calls barely dent your allowance." },
    { q: "Can I use my existing mobile number?", a: "Yes, you can easily divert your current mobile or landline to your custom AI agent number. Your customers never see a difference." },
    { q: "What happens if I go over my monthly minutes?", a: "It's just 15p per additional minute. We'll automatically bill you for the extra usage at the end of the month, so your phone never stops being answered." },
    { q: "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan later?", a: "Yes, you can change your plan at any time from your dashboard. Upgrades take effect immediately; downgrades apply at the next billing cycle." },
    { q: "Is there a setup fee?", a: "Normally £149, but we are currently waiving the setup fee for all new tradespeople this month. You only pay your flat monthly subscription." },
    { q: "Do you offer a free trial?", a: "We offer a 7-day risk-free trial. We'll build your AI agent and set it live. If you don't love it, you don't pay a penny." },
    { q: "Are there any hidden costs for the integrations?", a: "No. Connecting your AI agent to your existing calendar, CRM, or booking software is included in the Professional and Premium plans." }
