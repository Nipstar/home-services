    { q: "Will my customers know it's AI?", a: "Most can't tell. Natural voice, UK accent, proper conversations. Customers compliment tradesmen on their 'lovely receptionist.'" },
    { q: "I'm not techy at all — can I set this up?", a: "If you can answer a phone call, you can use this. We handle setup. Takes about a day." },
    { q: "What if someone has a genuine emergency?", a: "You set the rules. Burst pipe or no heating with a baby = immediate alert/patch-through." },
    { q: "What if the AI can't answer a question?", a: "It's honest: 'I don't have that info, but I'll make sure Dave gets back to you today.' Takes details, flags it." },
    { q: "How much does it cost?", a: "From £97/mo. No contracts, no setup fees. Free 7-day trial. One extra job pays for itself." },
    { q: "Can it book appointments in my diary?", a: "Yes — integrates with Tradify, ServiceM8, Google Calendar. Or captures details for you to book manually." },
    { q: "What about GDPR?", a: "Fully compliant. Encrypted. UK/EU servers. You control what's recorded and retention." },
    { q: "I already pay for an answering service — why switch?", a: "Traditional services: £1-2/call, generic operators, business hours only. AI: flat monthly fee, knows your trade, works 24/7." }

    { q: "Is there really no contract?", a: "Absolutely no contract. Everything is on a 30-day rolling basis. You can cancel with a single click anytime." },
    { q: "What constitutes a 'minute'?", a: "We only count actual conversation time when a human is speaking to the AI. Spam calls don't drain your allowance." },
    { q: "Can I use my existing mobile number?", a: "Yes, you can easily divert your current mobile or landline to your custom AI agent number." }
